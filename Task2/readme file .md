# Task 2: User Authentication Form

The goal of Task 2 is to build a **user authentication form** with **client-side validation** and store authenticated users inside the application using **LocalStorage**.

---

## Features

#  Login / Registration Form
The form collects:
- Name  
- Email  
- Password  

#  Client-Side Validation
The form validates:
- Name must be at least **2 characters**
- Email must be in **valid format**
- Password must be **minimum 6 characters**

If validation fails, the user sees an error message.

#  User Added to Application
- New users are **saved to LocalStorage**
- Existing users are treated as "login successful"
- All saved users appear in the **Users List** section

#   Storaging in local  (LocalStorage)
Users remain in the application even after refreshing the page.
